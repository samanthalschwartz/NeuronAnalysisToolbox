Summary:
This is a repository for compiled C++ code building libraries and mex files for single molecule
data and image analysis.

Organization:
 * projects/  -  This is the main project repository, each new unrelated project should have its own subdirectory
 * projects/DEstimator - Diffusion coefficient estimator

 * matlab/ - This is an svn:externals controlled directory which agglomerates the matlab code from each project into
      a common place, which can be added to the matlab path with the "genpath" recursive command.  This directory should
      contain only the matlab code from each project
 * cmake/ - Common cmake scripts

 * build - Build directory for out of source builds.  See: build/build.py
  ** build/linux.debug - Build location Linux 64-bit (debug)
  ** build/linux.release - Build location Linux 64-bit (release)
  ** build/w64.debug - Build location Windows 64-bit (debug)
  ** build/w64.release - Build location Windows 64-bit (release)

 * mex - Install location for mex files.  (For Windows also libraries and binaries)
  ** mex/mex.glnxa64/ - Install location for Mex modules for Linux 64-bit
  ** mex/mex.glnxa64.debug/ - Install location for Mex modules for Linux 64-bit
  ** mex/mex.w64/ - Install location for Mex code, libraries, and binaries for Windows 64-bit (release)
  ** mex/mex.w64.debug/ - Install location for Mex code, libraries, and binaries for Windows 64-bit (debug)

 * bin - Install location for Linux 64-bit binaries (release)
 * bin.debug - Install location for Linux 64-bit binaries (debug)
 * lib - Install location for Linux 64-bit libraries (release)
 * lib.debug - Install location for Linux 64-bit libraries (debug)
