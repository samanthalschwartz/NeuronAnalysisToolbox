ChangeList
Version 0.3
* Added pyCLIPS dependence
* Added AST based translation rules
* replaced xend with 0
* fixed simple conversion of a*b -> a*b when a or b is a scalar would default to dot(a,b)
* xend now replaced with zero so that 
    x(a:end-1) -> x[a:(0-1)] or x[a:-1] and x(a:end-b) -> x[a:0-b-1]
    x(end) -> x[end-1] 
  this may fail with some expression such as
  x(a:end+b)
* rules for using parentheses was wrong to do reversed priority of python operators
* using hstack and vstack rather than c_ and r_ notation.


Version 0.2
* Fixed elif statement
* fixed simple command expressions
* removed verbose printing
* added basic tests
