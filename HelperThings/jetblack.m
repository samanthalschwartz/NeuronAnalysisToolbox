function J = jetblack(m)
%Red    Variant of HSV
%   JET(M), a variant of HSV(M), is an M-by-3 matrix containing
%   the default colormap used by CONTOUR, SURF and PCOLOR.
%   The colors begin with dark blue, range through shades of
%   blue, cyan, green, yellow and red, and end with dark red.
%   JET, by itself, is the same length as the current figure's
%   colormap. If no figure exists, MATLAB creates one.
