%% Masking
% Mask the gephyrin channel
% Mask the gaba channel - both high and low sens

% Try and get a cell fill of transfected cell
%% Meausurments
% make background subtracted Geph and Gaba channels with reigon fill of
% dilated masks
%% Results

% given variables gephmask/gabamask

%For each cell: BEFORE vs AFTER
%     - # of Geph puncta/area (scatter/bar plot)
%     - Density of Geph puncta (CDF)
%     - Size of Geph puncta (CDF)

%     - # of Geph punct overlapping with Gaba mask (scatter/bar plot)
%     - Density of Gaba within Geph puncta (CDF)

%     - Size of Geph puncta from set of overlapping with Gaba (CDF)
%     - Density of Geph puncta from set of overlapping with Gaba (CDF)
