Clustering, PairCorr, ROITools, SimulateDomains, SRcluster are a set of MATLAB
classes that
o collect together various spatial clustering statistics and algorithms
  (hierarchal, DBSCAN [4 versions], Getis based, Voronoi based);
o pair auto- and cross-correlation curves and statistics
o allow the user to interactively select ROIs for arbitrary numbers of colors
o simulations of spatial domains (clusters) of fluorophore localizations that
  exhibit distributions of observations representing blinks; and 
o a top-down clustering algorithm to collapse clusters of observations of
  blinking fluorophores into a single estimate of the true location of the
  fluorophore using a log-likelihood hypothesis test (H-SET: Hierarchical
  Single Emitter Hypothesis Test).
Many of these algorithms operate in 3D as well as 2D.

The methodologies are described in more detail in the internal documentation
and in:
